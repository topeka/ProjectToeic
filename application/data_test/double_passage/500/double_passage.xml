		Passage 2: 

		To: I. Santelli
		From: R. Richards
		Subject: Re: Meeting reminder

		Isabelle,

		I’m sorry I won’t be able to make the meeting. I’m leaving for Sydney that morning and can’t get a later flight. Before I go, I’ll put on your desk the figures you’ll need for the second item on the meeting agenda. I’ve prepared a thorough report, so you’ll be able to have that part of the discussion without me. Also, Peter worked with me on this and can probably answer any questions.

		I’ll be meeting with Mr. Lockman first thing Friday and will send you the particulars later that day, or by Saturday morning at the latest.

		Ronald

		Passage 2: 

		To: Cathy Chang
		From: Georgette Blanc
		Subject: Banquet plans

		Dear Ms. Chang,

		I saw you hotel’s ad in the May 23 issue of the Business Gazette. I am planning the annual employee appreciation banquet for my company, Agrix International, and am interested in the possibility of hosting it at the Hotel Grandiflor.

		Our banquet is scheduled for the evening of July 15. We only plan to have half the number of guests mentioned in you ad, so I am sure you can accommodate our numbers. I think a five-course dinner would be too much, but I am interested in discussing with you the other two meal options. Mostly I am concerned about having both vegetarian and meat choices available for our guests.

		I am also interested in your professional assistance in  planning other aspects of the evening. We would need seating arrangements that are conductive to conversation but that will also accommodate the awards ceremony that is the main focus on the evening. We also would like to have dancing after the meal and would appreciate your assistance in selecting a suitable and affordable band.

		Please call me or my assistant, Robert de Luc at 656 555 0987 to discuss arrangements and costs.

		Georgette Blanc.

		Passage 2: 

		To: Susan Billings
		From: Tom Williamson
		Subject: Farewell Party

		Hi Susan,

		I’m sorry I couldn’t attend the party yesterday, as I’d planned, but I had a family emergency. Everything is OK now. I heard that everyone had a great time at the party and that you were able to raise $75 more than you expected. Fantastic. I’m sure Martha loved her gift. I did get a chance to sign the card before I left the office. Did you get the cake I sent over? It was a chocolate one from the Paris Bakery, so I hope it arrived on time for everyone to enjoy.

		See you at the meeting this afternoon.

		Tom
