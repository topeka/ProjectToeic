		on behalf of the company have long been out of land. As a result (1)……… recommendations from the 
		Budget Office, the following procedures will be adopted. Company personnel will no longer be given
		company credit cards to cover expenses while on out of town trips. Instead, all travel expenses, 
		with the (2)……… of airline tickets which will continue to be charged directly to the company, 
		will be paid for out of pocket. In order to receive (3)……… an expense report must be submitted 
		to your department head within ten days of returning from a trip. All charges must be itemized 
		on the report and accompanied by receipts. Approval of each item will be made at the discretion 
		of each department head, following of course, the company expense guidelines (see attached).

		such as entertainment, excessive taxi rides, and bar bills will not. I am sure you will all 
		understand the necessity of this strict attitude toward expense reporting. I am counting on 
		everyone’s cooperation.
