		<group_content>Dear Ms. Harwood,

I am writing to let you know of the exemplary care and service I received form (1)……… staff during my stay at the Tinkum Square Hotel last July. From the moment of my arrival until the day I (2)………, I received nothing but courteous and efficient service from all members of the hotel staff.

I especially want to bring to your attention two staff members who provided me with assistance above and beyond the call of duty. On my way to the airport after a pleasant week at Tinkum Square, I discovered that I had left my computer behind. I immediately called the manager on duty, Robert Dunstan who supervised an emergency search for my computer. After it was discovered in the hotel restaurant, Mr. Dunstan’s assistant, Martha Jones, got into a taxi and personally delivered the computer to me at the airport. It was all done so (3)……… that I had my computer in hand well before I had to board the plane.

I know that you would want to hear about this example of the loyalty and professionalism of Mr. Dunstan and Ms. Jones. I look forward to (4)……… at Tinkum Square during my next business trip to Portsmouth.

Sincerely,
James L.Keeman
